### Instructions

R markdown is a plain-text file format for integrating text and R code, and creating transparent, reproducible and interactive reports. An R markdown file (.Rmd) contains metadata, markdown and R code "chunks", and can be "knit" into numerous output types. Answer the test questions by adding R code to the fenced code areas below each item. There are questions that require a written answer that also need to be answered. Enter your comments in the space provided as shown below:

***Answer: (Enter your answer here.)*** 

Once completed, you will "knit" and submit the resulting .html document and the .Rmd file. The .html will present the output of your R code and your written answers, but your R code will not appear.  Your R code will appear in the .Rmd file. The resulting .html document will be graded and a feedback report returned with comments.  Points assigned to each item appear in the template.

**Before proceeding, look to the top of the .Rmd for the (YAML) metadata block, where the *title*, *author* and *output* are given. Please change *author* to include your name, with the format 'lastName, firstName.'**

If you encounter issues with knitting the .html, please send an email via Canvas to your TA.

Each code chunk is delineated by six (6) backticks; three (3) at the start and three (3) at the end. After the opening ticks, arguments are passed to the code chunk and in curly brackets. **Please do not add or remove backticks, or modify the arguments or values inside the curly brackets**. An example code chunk is included here: 

```{r exampleCodeChunk, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Comments are included in each code chunk, simply as prompts

#...R code placed here

#...R code placed here

```

R code only needs to be added inside the code chunks for each assignment item. However, there are questions that follow many assignment items. Enter your answers in the space provided. An example showing how to use the template and respond to a question follows.

-----

**Example Problem with Solution:**

Use *rbinom()* to generate two random samples of size 10,000 from the binomial distribution. For the first sample, use p = 0.45 and n = 10. For the second sample, use p = 0.55 and n = 10. Convert the sample frequencies to sample proportions and compute the mean number of successes for each sample. Present these statistics.

```{r Example, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

set.seed(123)
sample.one <- table(rbinom(10000, 10, 0.45)) / 10000
sample.two <- table(rbinom(10000, 10, 0.55)) / 10000

successes <- seq(0, 10)

round(sum(sample.one*successes), digits = 1) # [1] 4.5
round(sum(sample.two*successes), digits = 1) # [1] 5.5
```

**Question: How do the simulated expectations compare to calculated binomial expectations?**

***Answer:  The calculated binomial expectations are 10(0.45) = 4.5 and 10(0.55) = 5.5.  After rounding the simulated results, the same values are obtained.***

-----

Submit both the .Rmd and .html files for grading. You may remove the instructions and example problem above, but do not remove the YAML metadata block or the first, "setup" code chunk.  Address the steps that appear below and answer all the questions. Be sure to address each question with code and comments as needed.  You may use either base R functions or ggplot2 for the visualizations.

##Data Analysis #2

```{r analysis_setup1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Perform the following steps to start the assignment.
 
# 1) Load/attach the following packages via library():  flux, ggplot2, gridExtra, moments, rockchalk, car.
# NOTE:  packages must be installed via install.packages() before they can be loaded.

library(dplyr)
library(flux)
library(ggplot2)

str(mydata)

```

### Test Items starts from here - There are 10 sections - total of 75 points ##############

***#### Section 1: (5 points) ####***

(1)(a) Form a histogram and QQ plot using RATIO. Calculate skewness and kurtosis using 'rockchalk.' Be aware that with 'rockchalk', the kurtosis value has 3.0 subtracted from it which differs from the 'moments' package. 

```{r Part_1a, fig.width = 12}

hist = ggplot(mydata, aes(x = RATIO)) +
  geom_histogram()

qq = ggplot(mydata, aes(sample = RATIO)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  xlab("theoretical") +
  ylab("sample")

grid.arrange(hist, qq, ncol = 2)

cat("Skewness: ", skewness(mydata$RATIO),"\nKurtosis: ", kurtosis(mydata$RATIO))

```

(1)(b) Tranform RATIO using *log10()* to create L_RATIO (Kabacoff Section 8.5.2, p. 199-200). Form a histogram and QQ plot using L_RATIO. Calculate the skewness and kurtosis. Create a boxplot of L_RATIO differentiated by CLASS.

```{r Part_1b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}

mydata$L_RATIO <- log10(mydata$RATIO)

ggplot(mydata, aes(x = L_RATIO)) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(mydata, aes(sample = L_RATIO)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  xlab("theoretical") +
  ylab("sample")

ggplot(mydata, aes(x = CLASS, y = L_RATIO)) +
   geom_boxplot()

cat("Skewness: ", skewness(mydata$L_RATIO),"\nKurtosis: ", kurtosis(mydata$L_RATIO))

```

(1)(c) Test the homogeneity of variance across classes using *bartlett.test()* (Kabacoff Section 9.2.2, p. 222). 

```{r Part_1c}

bartlett.test(L_RATIO ~ CLASS, data = mydata)

```

**Essay Question: Based on steps 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, which variable RATIO or L_RATIO exhibits better conformance to a normal distribution with homogeneous variances across age classes?  Why?** 

***Answer: (L_RATIO better conforms to a normal distribution than RATIO. The L_RATIO QQ plot data points more closely align to the trend line than the RATIO QQ plot points. This indicates closer adherence to a normal distribution. For both Skewness and Kurtosis, numbers closer to zero indicate normality. Skewness and Kurtosis for L_RATIO are closer to 0 than RATIO's Skewness and Kurtosis. Finally, the L_RATIO histogram's distribution is better centered around the mean than RATIO's. )***


***#### Section 2 (10 points) ####***

(2)(a) Perform an analysis of variance with *aov()* on L_RATIO using CLASS and SEX as the independent variables (Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 212-229). Assume equal variances. Perform two analyses. First, fit a model with the interaction term CLASS:SEX. Then, fit a model without CLASS:SEX. Use *summary()* to obtain the analysis of variance tables (Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 227).

```{r Part_2a}

summary(aov(L_RATIO ~ CLASS + SEX + CLASS:SEX, data = mydata))


summary(aov(L_RATIO ~ CLASS + SEX, data = mydata))

```

**Essay Question:  Compare the two analyses.  What does the non-significant interaction term suggest about the relationship between L_RATIO and the factors CLASS and SEX?**

***Answer: (CLASS and SEX are significant in their ability to predict L_RATIO whereas the CLASS:SEX interaction term is NOT significant. The p-values produced by CLASS and SEX are significant at low values of alpha, 0 - 0.001 and .001 - .01, respectively. CLASS:SEX is only significant for analyses with confidence intervals less than 90%)***

(2)(b) For the model without CLASS:SEX (i.e. an interaction term), obtain multiple comparisons with the *TukeyHSD()* function. Interpret the results at the 95% confidence level (*TukeyHSD()* will adjust for unequal sample sizes). 

```{r Part_2b}

TukeyHSD(aov(L_RATIO ~ CLASS + SEX, data = mydata))

```

**Additional Essay Question:  first, interpret the trend in coefficients across age classes. What is this indicating about L_RATIO?  Second, do these results suggest male and female abalones can be combined into a single category labeled as 'adults?' If not, why not?**

***Answer: (The higher the p adj value, the less significantly different the groups means are from each other. The null hypothesis in this experiment is that the two groups analyzed are from the same population. For age groups A1 and A2, we accept this null hypothesis given that alpha is .05. For all other combinations of age groups, we reject the null hypothesis. L_RATIO can be used to determine statistically significant differences between age groups. We also accept the null hypothesis that Males and Females are from the same population, but reject the null hypothesis for I-F and I-M. The researcher can combine M-F into one Adult group.)***


***####  Section 3: (10 points) ####***

(3)(a1) Here, we will combine "M" and "F" into a new level, "ADULT". The code for doing this is given to you. For (3)(a1), all you need to do is execute the code as given.

```{r Part_3a1}
# Here, we show how to define the new variable TYPE using only base R functions:

mydata$TYPE <- factor(ifelse(mydata$SEX == "I", "I", "ADULT"))
table(mydata$TYPE)



```

(3)(a2)  Present side-by-side histograms of VOLUME. One should display infant volumes and, the other, adult volumes. 

```{r Part_3a2, fig.width = 12}

i = ggplot(subset(mydata, TYPE == "I"), aes(x = VOLUME)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Infant") +
  xlim(0,1000)

adult = ggplot(subset(mydata, TYPE == "ADULT"), aes(x = VOLUME)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Adult") +
  xlim(0,1000)

grid.arrange(i, adult, ncol = 2)

```


**Essay Question: Compare the histograms.  How do the distributions differ? Are there going to be any difficulties separating infants from adults based on VOLUME?**

***Answer: (The volumetric distributions of Infants and Adults have significant overlap. Nearly all Infants have a volume between 0 and 500, but more than half of Adults also have volumes in this range. The Adult distribution is more normally distributed. The Infant distribution has a right skew. The peak of the distribution for Infants is at a lower volume than the Adults, which intuitively makes sense.)***

(3)(b) Create a scatterplot of SHUCK versus VOLUME and a scatterplot of their base ten logarithms, labeling the variables as L_SHUCK and L_VOLUME. Please be aware the variables, L_SHUCK and L_VOLUME, present the data as orders of magnitude (i.e. VOLUME = 100 = 10^2 becomes L_VOLUME = 2). Use color to differentiate CLASS in the plots. Repeat using color to differentiate by TYPE. 

```{r Part_3b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}

mydata$L_SHUCK <- log10(mydata$SHUCK)
mydata$L_VOLUME <- log10(mydata$VOLUME)

class = ggplot(mydata, aes(y = SHUCK, x = VOLUME, color = CLASS)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Shuck by Volume by Class")

class_l = ggplot(mydata, aes(y = L_SHUCK, x = L_VOLUME, color = CLASS)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Log 10 Shuck by Log 10 Volume by Class")

type = ggplot(mydata, aes(y = SHUCK, x = VOLUME, color = TYPE)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Shuck by Volume by Type")

type_l = ggplot(mydata, aes(y = L_SHUCK, x = L_VOLUME, color = TYPE)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Log 10 Shuck by Log 10 Volume by Type")

grid.arrange(class, class_l, type, type_l)

```

**Additional Essay Question:  Compare the two scatterplots. What effect(s) does log-transformation appear to have on the variability present in the plot?  What are the implications for linear regression analysis? Where do the various CLASS levels appear in the plots? Where do the levels of TYPE appear in the plots?**

***Answer: (The log-transformation significantly decreases the variability. This will improve the performance of a linear regression analysis. Though the nature of the relationship does not change after the transformation, a linear regression analysis on the log-transformation will result in lower error. We see a more clear delineation between Infants and Adults post log-transformation with SHUCK and VOLUME being lower for Infants than Adults. We see the same pattern for classes, with SHUCK and VOLUME increasing as CLASS increases. We see significant overlap for classes A2 - A5. Within these groups, we see that A5 has higher VOLUME, but lower SHUCK and that the opposite is true for A3. Data points across both CLASS and TYPE plots are bunched in the top right rather than the lower left.)***


***####   Section 4: (5 points) ####***

(4)(a1) Since abalone growth slows after class A3, infants in classes A4 and A5 are considered mature and candidates for harvest. You are given code in (4)(a1) to reclassify the infants in classes A4 and A5 as ADULTS. 

```{r Part_4a1}

mydata$TYPE[mydata$CLASS == "A4" | mydata$CLASS == "A5"] <- "ADULT"
table(mydata$TYPE)

```

(4)(a2) Regress L_SHUCK as the dependent variable on L_VOLUME, CLASS and TYPE (Kabacoff Section 8.2.4, p. 178-186, the Data Analysis Video #2 and Black Section 14.2). Use the multiple regression model: L_SHUCK ~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE. Apply *summary()* to the model object to produce results.

```{r Part_4a2}


summary(lm(formula = L_SHUCK ~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE, data = mydata))

```

**Essay Question:  Interpret the trend in CLASS levelcoefficient estimates? (Hint:  this question is not asking if the estimates are statistically significant. It is asking for an interpretation of the pattern in these coefficients, and how this pattern relates to the earlier displays).**

***Answer: (In earlier plots, we saw the increase in SHUCK slow as an abalone aged, whereas its VOLUME increased more rapidly. For instance, in 3b we see A3 samples have proportionately higher SHUCK, but lower VOLUME. However, A5's had proportionately higher VOLUME than SHUCK. L_VOLUME has a positive estimate whereas A2 - A5 have negative ones. This means that larger increases in VOLUME will result in higher SHUCK weights, whereas larger increases in CLASS will more slowly affect SHUCK.)***

**Additional Essay Question:  Is TYPE an important predictor in this regression? (Hint:  This question is not asking if TYPE is statistically significant, but rather how it compares to the other independent variables in terms of its contribution to predictions of L_SHUCK for harvesting decisions.)  Explain your conclusion.**

***Answer: (Having a coefficient of -0.021 is not negligible, but it is one of the least important factors in this analysis. Its coefficient is the smallest out of all with the exception of CLASS A2. It is logical that TYPE adds little value to this model, since CLASS groupings are more or less proxies for the TYPE feature. If you re-run the model without TYPE, RSE increases by 0.00026. I would take precautions to determine whether or not including TYPE leads to overfitting in the model. If it does not, then it would not hurt to include it though it's affect on model performance with these other features is minimal.)***

The next two analysis steps involve an analysis of the residuals resulting from the regression model in (4)(a) (Kabacoff Section 8.2.4, p. 178-186, the Data Analysis Video #2).

-----

***#### Section 5: (5 points) ####***

(5)(a) If "model" is the regression object, use model$residuals and construct a histogram and QQ plot. Compute the skewness and kurtosis. Be aware that with 'rockchalk,' the kurtosis value has 3.0 subtracted from it which differs from the 'moments' package. 

```{r Part_5am, fig.width = 12}

model = lm(formula = L_SHUCK ~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE, data = mydata)

residuals = residuals(model)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

hist(residuals, col = "red", main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residual")

qqnorm(residuals, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(residuals, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)

cat("Skewness: ", skewness(residuals),"\nKurtosis: ", kurtosis(residuals))

```

(5)(b) Plot the residuals versus L_VOLUME, coloring the data points by CLASS and, a second time, coloring the data points by TYPE. Keep in mind the y-axis and x-axis may be disproportionate which will amplify the variability in the residuals. Present boxplots of the residuals differentiated by CLASS and TYPE (These four plots can be conveniently presented on one page using *par(mfrow..)* or *grid.arrange()*. Test the homogeneity of variance of the residuals across classes using *bartlett.test()* (Kabacoff Section 9.3.2, p. 222).  

```{r Part_5b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}

mydata_residual = cbind(mydata, residuals)

scatter_class = ggplot(mydata, aes(y = residuals, x = L_VOLUME, color = CLASS)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Residuals versus L_VOLUME by CLASS")

scatter_type = ggplot(mydata, aes(y = residuals, x = L_VOLUME, color = TYPE)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Residuals versus L_VOLUME by TYPE")

box_class = ggplot(mydata, aes(x = CLASS, y = residuals)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Residuals by CLASS")

box_type = ggplot(mydata, aes(x = TYPE, y = residuals)) +
   geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Residuals by TYPE")

grid.arrange(scatter_class, scatter_type, box_class, box_type, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)

```

**Essay Question:  What is revealed by the displays and calculations in (5)(a) and (5)(b)? Does the model 'fit'?  Does this analysis indicate that L_VOLUME, and ultimately VOLUME, might be useful for harvesting decisions? Discuss.**

***Answer: (The model's residuals are normally distributed and centered around a mean of 0. This indicates that the model fits. A normal distribution is desired in a residual plot because a normal distribution of error implies that error in a model is random rather than patterned. If a model's error adheres to a pattern this indicates a gap in the fit, whereas random error shows that the fit is appropriate. L_VOLUME and, by extension, VOLUME could be useful for predicting harvesting decisions since there is a normal distribution in the residuals.)***

Harvest Strategy:

There is a tradeoff faced in managing abalone harvest. The infant population must be protected since it represents future harvests. On the other hand, the harvest should be designed to be efficient with a yield to justify the effort. This assignment will use VOLUME to form binary decision rules to guide harvesting. If VOLUME is below a "cutoff" (i.e. a specified volume), that individual will not be harvested. If above, it will be harvested. Different rules are possible.The Management needs to make a decision to implement 1 rule that meets the business goal.

The next steps in the assignment will require consideration of the proportions of infants and adults harvested at different cutoffs. For this, similar "for-loops" will be used to compute the harvest proportions. These loops must use the same values for the constants min.v and delta and use the same statement "for(k in 1:10000)."  Otherwise, the resulting infant and adult proportions cannot be directly compared and plotted as requested. Note the example code supplied below.

-----

***#### Section 6: (5 points) ####***

(6)(a) A series of volumes covering the range from minimum to maximum abalone volume will be used in a "for loop" to determine how the harvest proportions change as the "cutoff" changes. Code for doing this is provided.

```{r Part_6a}

idxi <- mydata$TYPE == "I"
idxa <- mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"

max.v <- max(mydata$VOLUME)
min.v <- min(mydata$VOLUME)
delta <- (max.v - min.v)/10000
prop.infants <- numeric(10000)
prop.adults <- numeric(10000)
volume.value <- numeric(10000)

total.infants <- sum(idxi)  
total.adults <- sum(idxa)

for (k in 1:10000) { 
	value <- min.v + k*delta
	volume.value[k] <- value
	prop.infants[k] <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[idxi] <= value)/total.infants
	prop.adults[k] <-  sum(mydata$VOLUME[idxa] <= value)/total.adults
}

```

(6)(b) Our first "rule" will be protection of all infants. We want to find a volume cutoff that protects all infants, but gives us the largest possible harvest of adults. We can achieve this by using the volume of the largest infant as our cutoff. You are given code below to identify the largest infant VOLUME and to return the proportion of adults harvested by using this cutoff. You will need to modify this latter code to return the proportion of infants harvested using this cutoff. Remember that we will harvest any individual with VOLUME greater than our cutoff.

```{r Part_6b}
# Largest infant volume
max_inf_vol = max(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"])  # [1] 526.6383

# Proportion of adults harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > max_inf_vol) /
  total.adults  # [1] 0.2476573

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > max_inf_vol) /
  total.infants

# If we use the largest infant volume, we harvest approximately 24.8% of adults and 0%,
# as expected, of infants.

```

(6)(c) Our next approaches will look at what happens when we use the median infant and adult harvest VOLUMEs. Using the median VOLUMEs as our cutoffs will give us (roughly) 50% harvests. We need to identify the median volumes and calculate the resulting infant and adult harvest proportions for both.

```{r Part_6c}
# Add code to determine the median infant volume:

median_infant_vol = median(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"])

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested

sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > median_infant_vol) /
  total.infants


# Add code to calculate the proportion of adults harvested

sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > median_infant_vol) /
  total.adults


# If we use the median infant volume as our cutoff, we harvest almost 50% of our infants
# and a little more than 93% of our adults.


# Add code to determine the median adult volume:

median_adult_vol = median(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"])


# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested

sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > median_adult_vol) /
  total.infants

# Add code to calculate the proportion of adults harvested

sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > median_adult_vol) /
  total.adults

# If we use the median adult volume as our cutoff, we harvest almost 50% of adults
# and approximately 2.4% of infants.

```

(6)(d) Next, we will create a plot showing the infant conserved proportions (i.e. "not harvested," the prop.infants vector) and the adult conserved proportions (i.e. prop.adults) as functions of volume.value. We will add vertical A-B lines and text annotations for the three (3) "rules" considered, thus far:  "protect all infants," "median infant" and "median adult." Your plot will have two (2) curves - one (1) representing infant and one (1) representing adult proportions as functions of volume.value - and three (3) A-B lines representing the cutoffs determined in (6)(b) and (6)(c).

```{r Part_6d, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}

prop_data = as.data.frame(cbind(volume.value, prop.infants, prop.adults))

ggplot(prop_data, aes(x = volume.value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = prop.infants, color = "prop.infants")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = prop.adults, color = "prop.adults"))  +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Adults and Infants Protected") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  xlab("Volume") +
   geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_infant_vol) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_adult_vol) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol) +
  geom_text(aes(x = median_infant_vol, y = .75,
                label = paste("Median\n Infant\n Volume\n",
                              round(median_infant_vol,1)), hjust = 1.25)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = median_adult_vol, y = .75,
                label = paste("Median\n Adult\n Volume\n", round(median_adult_vol,1)),
                hjust = 1.25)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = max_inf_vol, y = .75,
                label = paste("Largest\n Infant\n Volume\n",round(max_inf_vol,1)),
                hjust = 1.25))
  

```

**Essay Question:  The two 50% "median" values serve a descriptive purpose illustrating the difference between the populations. What do these values suggest regarding possible cutoffs for harvesting?** 

***Answer: (We are solving for the need to have a volumetric cutoff that maximizes possible Adult harvest while minimizing Infant harvest. Using the median for Adults and Infants as cutoffs will likely result in harvests that are too high for Infants and too low for Adults, respectively. Setting up these median cutoffs provide good upper bounds that will inform the creation of a more mutually beneficial cutoff.)***

More harvest strategies:

This part will address the determination of a cutoff volume.value corresponding to the observed maximum difference in harvest percentages of adults and infants. In other words, we want to find the volume value such that the vertical distance between the infant curve and the adult curve is maximum. To calculate this result, the vectors of proportions from item (6) must be used. These proportions must be converted from "not harvested" to "harvested" proportions by using (1 - prop.infants) for infants, and (1 - prop.adults) for adults. The reason the proportion for infants drops sooner than adults is that infants are maturing and becoming adults with larger volumes.

-----

***#### Section 7: (10 points)  ####***

(7)(a) Evaluate a plot of the difference ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)) versus volume.value. Compare to the 50% "split" points determined in (6)(a). There is considerable variability present in the peak area of this plot. The observed "peak" difference may not be the best representation of the data. One solution is to smooth the data to determine a more representative estimate of the maximum difference.

```{r Part_7a}

prop_data$prop_difference <- (1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)

ggplot(prop_data, aes(x = volume.value)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = prop_difference), color = "pink") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_infant_vol) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_adult_vol) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol) +
  geom_text(aes(x = median_infant_vol - 100, y = .5,
                 label = paste("Median\n Infant\n Volume\n",
                               round(median_infant_vol,1)))) +
  geom_text(aes(x = median_adult_vol, y = .25,
                label = paste("Median\n Adult\n Volume\n", round(median_adult_vol,1)),
                hjust = 1.25)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = max_inf_vol, y = .5,
                label = paste("Max\n Infant\n Volume\n",round(max_inf_vol,1)),
                hjust = -0.5))


```

(7)(b) Since curve smoothing is not studied in this course, code is supplied below. Execute the following code to create a smoothed curve to append to the plot in (a). The procedure is to individually smooth (1-prop.adults) and (1-prop.infants) before determining an estimate of the maximum difference. 

```{r Part_7b}

y.loess.a <- loess(1 - prop.adults ~ volume.value, span = 0.25,

```

(7)(c) Present a plot of the difference ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)) versus volume.value with the variable smooth.difference superimposed. Determine the volume.value corresponding to the maximum smoothed difference (Hint:  use *which.max()*). Show the estimated peak location corresponding to the cutoff determined.

Include, side-by-side, the plot from (6)(d) but with a fourth vertical A-B line added. That line should intercept the x-axis at the "max difference" volume determined from the smoothed curve here.

```{r Part_7c, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}

(7)(d) What separate harvest proportions for infants and adults would result if this cutoff is used? Show the separate harvest proportions. We will actually calculate these proportions in two ways:  first, by 'indexing' and returning the appropriate element of the (1 - prop.adults) and (1 - prop.infants) vectors, and second, by simply counting the number of adults and infants with VOLUME greater than the vlume threshold of interest.

Code for calculating the adult harvest proportion using both approaches is provided.

```{r Part_7d}

(1 - prop.adults)[which.max(smooth.difference)]  # [1] 0.7416332
# OR,
sum(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT", "VOLUME"] >
      volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]) / total.adults # [1] 0.7416332

```

-----

There are alternative ways to determine cutoffs. Two such cutoffs are described below.

-----

***####  Section 8: (10 points)  ####***

(8)(a) Harvesting of infants in CLASS "A1" must be minimized. The smallest volume.value cutoff that produces a zero harvest of infants from CLASS "A1" may be used as a baseline for comparison with larger cutoffs. Any smaller cutoff would result in harvesting infants from CLASS "A1."  

Compute this cutoff, and the proportions of infants and adults with VOLUME exceeding this cutoff. Code for determining this cutoff is provided. Show these proportions. You may use either the 'indexing' or 'count' approach, or both.

```{r Part_8a}

zero_a1_inf_vol = volume.value[volume.value > max(mydata[mydata$CLASS == "A1" & mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"])][1] # [1] 206.786

```

(8)(b) Next, append one (1) more vertical A-B line to our (6)(d) graph. This time, showing the "zero A1 infants" cutoff from (8)(a). This graph should now have five (5) A-B lines:  "protect all infants," "median infant," "median adult," "max difference" and "zero A1 infants."

```{r Part_8b, fig.width = 12}

ggplot(prop_data, aes(x = volume.value)) +

                hjust = 1.25))

```


***#### Section 9: (5 points) ####***

(9)(a) Construct an ROC curve by plotting (1 - prop.adults) versus (1 - prop.infants). Each point which appears corresponds to a particular volume.value. Show the location of the cutoffs determined in (6), (7) and (8) on this plot and label each. 

```{r Part_9, fig.width = 8.5}

```

(9)(b) Numerically integrate the area under the ROC curve and report your result. This is most easily done with the *auc()* function from the "flux" package.   Areas-under-curve, or AUCs, greater than 0.8 are taken to indicate good discrimination potential. 

```{r Part_9b}

auc((1 - prop.infants), (1 - prop.adults))

```


***#### Section 10: (10 points) ####***

(10)(a) Prepare a table showing each cutoff along with the following:
 	1) true positive rate (1-prop.adults,
 	2) false positive rate (1-prop.infants),
 	3) harvest proportion of the total population

To calculate the total harvest proportions, you can use the 'count' approach, but ignoring TYPE; simply count the number of individuals (i.e. rows) with VOLUME greater than a given threshold and divide by the total number of individuals in our dataset.

**Essay Question: Based on the ROC curve, it is evident a wide range of possible "cutoffs" exist. Compare and discuss the five cutoffs determined in this assignment.**   

***Answer:( No single cutoff will work in all circumstances. As conditions in the population adjust so should the strategy to maintain a balance between preserving the population and maximizing the harvest. In terms of population preservation, as cutoff volumes increase the strategy to preserve becomes more aggressive. That is to say the most aggressive preservation strategy would be to set the cutoff at maximum infant volume, where FPR is 0 and the least aggressive would be the median infant volume where FPR is nearly 50%. It is important for regulators setting these cutoff levels to maintain a healthy equilibrium for the abalone population. The current state of the population is poor, commercial catch has dropped over 40%. This means that abalone are significantly overfished. An aggressive preservation approach is needed to bring abalone population to healthy levels. This may be to the chagrin of commercial fleets; but if the current state holds there will be no abalone at all to catch in the future. In a theoretical future state there may be too many abalone in the ocean, where high population levels make food scarce or increase the risk of disease being spread. This may cause a massive drop in the population, affecting commercial fleet haul. In this scenario, applying the median infant cutoff may be appropriate to bring the population back into balance. I believe that a good equilibrium or ideal state cutoff would be one of the three middle cutoffs as it is not too far on either the preservation or harvest side. )***



**Final Essay Question:  Assume you are expected to make a presentation of your analysis to the investigators How would you do so?  Consider the following in your answer:**

1. Would you make a specific recommendation or outline various choices and tradeoffs?
2. What qualifications or limitations would you present regarding your analysis?
3. If it is necessary to proceed based on the current analysis, what suggestions would you have for  implementation of a cutoff?  
4. What suggestions would you have for planning future abalone studies of this type? 

***Answer: (1 - I'd do both. I'd outline the choices, apply caveats and then present a recommendation. I generally find that making a recommendation frames these conversations in the best way possible. Rather than simply laying out the facts to the stakeholders and opening up the floor for discussion, also provide a baseline for that discussion in the form of an initial recommendation. 2 - I would qualify that any cutoff chosen would not apply to conditions where the abalone population is either at an ideal state or overpopulated. The discussion is centered around setting a cutoff where the population has been significantly overfished. It is unclear from where in the world the dataset is taken. It may be the case that this analysis was sampled from an abalone population on the other side of the world than the audience for this analysis. 3 - Given the current state of the abalone fishery, I would recommend setting the cutoff at maximum infant volume. Implementing this cutoff would require that stakeholders communicate the new regulations to the commercial fleets and to ensure that officials are enforcing the regulations when the vessels return to shore. It would also be beneficial for governing bodies the preside over different abalone fisheries to coordinate their cutoff levels in order to expedite their recovery. 4 - In the future I would recommend finding better ways to predict abalone age. Preferably one that does not require each sample to be killed? I have to imagine that there is a way to examine the outer shell of an abalone and make an assessment of its age based on either salinity on the shell or possibly the amount of sediment that the shell has accumulated. Higher salinity and sediment build up levels may indicate the abalone is a certain age. I would also like to see if there is any variance within a population based on exactly where a sample is pulled from. Maybe abalone that live in shallow water fare better than deep water populations, etc.)***
